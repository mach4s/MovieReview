This web app uses OMDb API to retrieve movies and its information. OMDb API only works for retrieving movie by movie title or movie ID.
JQuery was used to create a comment section for the reviews.


Bugs and Errors:
Since we could only retrieve the movie data by ID or title, we could not create the genres pages by pulling movies in specific genres. Instead, we search titles with words that are typical in the genre field to populate the list
  e.g. "Love" for Romance genre
  
We did not use a database to store the comment section for each movie possible. The comment section is the same for all of the individual movies.
